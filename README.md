# Kanji Records

# Purpose:

This application is designed to assist in learning Japanese kanji.
There are a few txt files with the top kanji's (in order of frequency)

# How-To:

Just change the file name in the main.py. Right now, I'm using 50_kanji.txt because it's the only one correctly formated.
